TODO: TypeCoercion doesn't work for variables in comparisons, but only for literals.
calling getType() on the child vars crashes as the variable is not bound yet.
See wnt_astNode.cpp: // TODO: Make this work for arbitrary expressions and not just literals.

TODO: operator overloading doesn't work in template bodies.

TODO: def lt(real x, real y) real : x < y  Doesn't give error even though return type is wrong.
