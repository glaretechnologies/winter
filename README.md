Winter
======
Winter is a high performance functional programming language, designed to be embedded in C++ applications.

It can run on CPUs via LLVM JIT compilation, and a subset of it can run on GPUs via translation to OpenCL.

It serves as the shading language and implementation language for parts of Indigo Renderer (https://www.indigorenderer.com/) and also for Chaotica Fractals (https://www.chaoticafractals.com/).
